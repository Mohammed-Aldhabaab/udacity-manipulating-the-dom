# Project Description:

One of my projects with Front End Web Developer - MCIT Nanodegree Program. This project aims to practice real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The following are scenarios that are manipulated on the DOM:

- Building the navigation menu dynamically.
- Building Responsive nav bar for the small screen.
- Hiding the nav bar when scrolling down and scrolling up makes it appear again
- Hiding fixed navigation bar while not scrolling.
- Adding progress bar.
- Adding a scroll to the top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Adding an active state to navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Adding an active state to sections when a section is in the viewport.
- Scrolling to the sections using nav bar elements when clicking on them.
- Making sections collapsible.<br><br>

Note:
- Html and CSS files have been given by Udacity to practice manipulating the DOM. And have edited some parts of them as well as added a javascript file.
